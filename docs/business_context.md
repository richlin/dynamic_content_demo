Goal: 
- Demonstrate how American Express can use a single email template framework to serve multiple customer segments.
- Show how content can be dynamically varied (A/B testing) based on segment to optimize click-through and engagement.

Segments and Personalization:
Identify 2–3 hypothetical customer segments (e.g., “High Spender,” “Budget Conscious,” “Business Traveler,” etc.).
For each segment, define different email components or offers:
- Headlines and sub-headlines
- Images
- Personalized greeting (using First Name)
- Call-to-action text or placement
Ensure that each segment has a slightly different configuration of the email body so the stakeholder can see how each variation might perform.

A/B Testing Scenarios:
- Provide at least four variations for each critical piece of content (e.g., headline, hero image).
- The system should be able to:
- Randomly assign recipients in the same segment to Variation A or Variation B, or
- Allow a business rule that assigns Variation A to some segments and Variation B to others.

User/Recipient Data:
- Store and retrieve the following:
    - First Name (for personalization)
    - Email Address (for sending demo emails)
    - Segment (mapping the user to a set of dynamic content rules)
- Keep the data minimal (no sensitive information) since this is for demonstration purposes.

Sending Demo Emails:
- The application should enable:
- A quick way to load lists of test recipients (for demonstration).
- Triggering the email send to each recipient.
- Logging or displaying a “send confirmation” for demonstration.

Metrics or Tracking (Mocked):
- Optionally demonstrate how open/click metrics could be integrated. For the demo, simple placeholders or a sample “dashboard” is enough.


## Business Considerations:
- Emphasize how easily a marketer can change the subject line or offer for each segment without needing a new full template for each scenario.
- Show how small changes (images, headlines) can be tested quickly to optimize conversions.
- Stress that in a real production environment, more robust reporting on open/click rates would be integrated.
